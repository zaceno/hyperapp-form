# Hyperapp-form

No matter what framework you're using, working with forms
can be frustrating. It often involves lots of plumbing that can feel pretty
tangential to the main logic of your app. This library tries to
alleviate some of this drudgery for developers using Hyperapp (v2)

For now, it is published on npm as @zxlabs/hyperapp-form

How to use it? See the example gallery at [https://zaceno.github.io/hyperapp-form](https://zaceno.github.io/hyperapp-form)
